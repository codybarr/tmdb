= tmdb

Simple ruby wrapper for _The MovieDB_ based on HTTParty

== Installation

run `gem install tmdb`

== Compatability

I wrote this gem while using ruby 2.0.0, I haven't tested compatability with other versions.

== Testing

Make sure to create an 'api_key' file at 'test/api_key' in order to run the tests.  I'll work offline testing into the gem later.
