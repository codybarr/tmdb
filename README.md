# tmdb

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/tmdb.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/tmdb)

Simple ruby wrapper for _The MovieDB_ based on HTTParty

## Installation

**tmdb** is hosted at rubygems.org

`gem install tmdb`

## Compatability

I wrote this gem while using ruby 2.0.0, I haven't tested compatability with other versions.

## Usage

_TODO_

_tmdb is a work in progress and isn't really usable at the moment.  It's my first gem so I'm going to take some time working on it_

## Testing

Make sure to create an 'api_key' file at 'test/api_key' in order to run the tests.  I'll work offline testing into the gem later.
